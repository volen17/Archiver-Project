## Hello, there!

To use this app for LZ77 compressing/decompressing, 
you should run it with one of these commands:

```
cargo run compress <directory/filename>
```

or

```
cargo run decompress <directory/filename>
```


You can find your file in the same directory after (de)compression with(out) an extension ".compression"
You can find your directory of files in a new folder with the same name as the previous one, but with a suffix "-(de)compressed"

            
## Enjoy! :)
